  <figcaption>Adaptive Retraction is a Gcode script editor program that nonlinearly increases the retraction distance of FDM printers as travel distance increases, in order to combat oozing. It works with Cura on Windows 10, or any slicer that uses G0 retraction moves. Click the link up top to download. A read-me is included with the software. See the video below for a quick rundown.
