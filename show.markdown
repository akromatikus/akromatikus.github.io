  <figcaption>The heart of the boat, containing the stepper circuits, arduino, tranciever, and battery. An interesting discovery while making it involved the small 'gears' that the rubber bands wrap over. At first I made them concave because the bands kept sliding off, but the problem was made worse. That gave me the idea to do the opposite and make them convex, and upon further research I confirmed that this was the correct approach, and it worked! </figcaption>

  <figcaption>The controller for the boat. Making the controls functional was quite fun.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>A foot pedal I designed using a load cell. I send the signal into my computer using serial, and I am able to use that signal to control any parameters I want inside my DAW (digital audio workstation). Its primary purpose is as a hi-hat foot pedal. A piezo underneath further allows me to trigger the hi-hat by tapping it against the base, much like a real hi-hat.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I added a spring to make it sturdier and more reliable.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>Some drum pads I designed, with piezos underneath. I am able to get some nice, realistic drum sounds sout of these, especially in regards    to cymbals and hihats. </figcaption>

  <figcaption>A side project I've been working on. But I've recently put it on pause in favor of more important projects, like my solar powered bluetooth enabled pet rock, or my battery powered skis.  </figcaption>
