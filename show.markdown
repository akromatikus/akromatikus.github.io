  <figcaption>A quick display of the controls of a simple 3-D printed paddle boat which I designed using Autocad.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>The paddle boat in action. A simple bouyancy calculation ensured that the boat would only vertically displace about one inch of water. Also, I calculated drag forces on the paddles and boat which led to a theoretical speed of about a quarter meter per second, and this ended up being less than ten percent off from the actual speed.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>The heart of the boat, containing the stepper circuits, arduino, tranciever, and battery. One of the most interesting realizations I had while making it was the design of the rubber band gears. The bands kept sliding off, so I decided to make the gears concave, only for the problem to be made worse! Consequently, I decided to make them convex instead, and this worked! Some research confirmed that this is indeed a legitimate approach to the problem that has been known for centuries. Finding and understanding unintuitive solutions to a problem is one of science's most endearing qualities.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>The controller for the boat. Making the physical controls functional was quite fun. I tried to make everything as compact as possible for this project. Was that necessary? No, but it was a fun challenge nonetheless.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>A hi-hat demonstration combining piezo pads and a custom foot pedal, along with some software voodoo in max/msp (A work in progress).</figcaption>

  <figcaption>The rest of the drum pads, with piezos underneath. I am able to get some nice, realistic drum sounds out of these, especially in regards to cymbals and hi-hats. Since the proximity of an excitation to a piezo changes the amplitude, three piezos are used on the edges of each pad so that any tapping in the middle gives consistent results.   </figcaption>

  <figcaption>A foot pedal I designed using a load cell. The pressure signal is sent to a pc using an arduino and serial, and that signal is used to control any parameters I want inside a DAW (digital audio workstation). Its primary purpose is as a hi-hat foot pedal. Originally, a piezo underneath would be triggered by tapping the pedal against the base. This signal would then be used to create a "foot" tap sound. However, it proved unreliable, so I opted to used the position of the pedal to trigger an impulse instead, with the velocity of the pedal determining the amplitude of the impulse. Here is a quick demonstration, used as a wah wah pedal.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>A side project I've been working on. But I've recently put it on pause in favor of more important projects, like my solar powered, bluetooth enabled pet rock, and my underwater hairdryer.  </figcaption>
